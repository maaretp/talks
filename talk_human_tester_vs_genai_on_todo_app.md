# The Human Tester vs genAI on To Do App - a Comparative Study

Testing profession has a problem, and the problem is not generative AI. It is that our automation testers don't know how to test, and our manual tester's don't know how to automate, and we need people who can do both: contemporary exploratory testing. 

ToDo App is a popular developer frontend showcase with many implementations to same set of requirements and constraints. I set out to test it, and have people test it to assess the categories of feedback they provide. Turns out the comparison works for people and genAI giving feedback based on images and feature  listing. 

There is no reason for humans to not resolve to a genAI baseline, but we need to do better at where we set the bar than the automated average answers. That takes some work on learning more about how to do great at contemporary exploratory testing, including these tools in the mix.
