# Exploratory Testing Work Course

*Length: 1 day*

Testing activities account for a significant portion of costs we invest into software development, and testing is done by all people participating in development, including specialized testers. The skill of delivering the right information effectively and efficiently through testing is the core of this course: exploratory testing frames the thinking about the system, and engulfs the idea of creating artifacts to support testing.

In this course, we work on building the good habits of skilled exploratory testing, layer by layer through creating a shared learning experience. We work on different types of testing tasks as a group: from analyzing a user interface to analysing an individual feature; from relying on requirements documentation to free associations; from focusing on coverage to focusing on understanding problems; from user interface to peeking at the code.

You get to experience exploratory testing hands-on and learn by doing: we plan testing, tests and run our tests, and report bugs. We learn testing skills through testing in a group format. Our test target is an open-source editor tool that is easy to learn. We start with limited and defined functionalities, and learn essential thinking skills and approaches to manage one’s own testing work & scope. 

Join in to experience how exploratory testing is different from traditional testing, and collect practical ideas to amplify your testing. With exploratory testing, we make the best possible use of our limited time with intelligent testing that delivers results!
