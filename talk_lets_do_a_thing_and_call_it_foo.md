# Let's do a thing and call it foo

## Blurb

Let’s take computer assisted software authorship and consider ourselves held accountable for results. We do a thing of testing, and call it Foo until we have a shared experience. 
Foo is what allows us to be accountable, and we learn that there are 5 layers of oracles we can choose to apply, and from our example can take ideas of how to apply those further. 

## Description

It feels like the world of testing has gone absurd over words and definitions, and as a testing practitioner building products, what I really care for is results and learning. So let’s do a thing of testing, and call it Foo until we have a shared experience. 

What Foo looks like is that we’ll take computer assisted software authorship as our developer, write a comment and get to an implementation. As the human pair programmer, we’re probably going to be held accountable for results when we pass that forward. Foo is what allows us to be accountable. Not just on correctness of implementation but our program fitting the domain it is created for. 

Having done Foo, we have:
Started with an invisible list of bugs we turn visible into an answer key to bugs; found some bugs others may have missed
Identified the results gap between our computer assisted software authorship and what we deem necessary for the domain
Created means of replenishing some of our results when changes take place

We learn that there are 5 layers of oracles we can choose to apply, and from our example can take ideas of how to apply those further. So how to Foo like you meant it? Let’s conclude with ways of turning up the Foo. 

Key takeaways:
* How to apply five levels of oracles when exploring an application
* Being accountable for solutions is about testing them, no matter what we call it
* Exploratory testing in action on unit testing
