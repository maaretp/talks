# Lessons Learned from Landing a Job Offer with GenAI

*Length: 45 min* 

On first weeks of GitHub Copilot availability, I had a pair programming interview for a position I was considering. Armed with python and GitHub Copilot, I landed a job offer and lessons about simple programming problems and their testing in age of AI. In this talk, we start with revisiting the experience of pairing that makes a story with great takeaways on nature of testing, and build on that for two years of experiences in benefitting from GitHub Copilot in programmatic testing work. 

Key takeways:
* GenAI code generation allows you to turn a programming problem into a testing problem
* Testing problems are the hard problems
* GenAI code generation in IDE is a useful tool, with 2nd degree impacts to consider
