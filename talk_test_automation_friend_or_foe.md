# Test Automation - Friend or Foe?

Supporting evidence does not teach us as much as opposing evidence. We are people who support and oppose on principle, in search of knowledge. We are balancing perspectives of friends and foes, professionally, all day long. 

We've been at this test automation thing quite a while, and three decades has made me the space to come to a principle that helps my projects succeed slightly more often with test automation: Time used on warning about test automation is time away from succeeding with it. We know from a particular literature genre of romance novels that tropes starting with friends or foes both end up with love, and we could adult up to improve our communication to more purposeful change. 

A year ago, we set up a panel conversation to seek the ideas of ending well off with test automation. In this talk, we lend the tension of disagreements of past, to enable learning, combined with the stories of real projects. 

Maybe at this time of AI and getting computers to 'acting humanly', we need to team with an old enemy to make sense of how we peacefully coexist with the new, with healthy boundaries keeping the friendship in check. 

Key takeaways: 

* When stakes are high, we work with friends and foes
* How to increase odds of good results we can like with the tools
* How to navigate the recruitment trap and the in-company growth plains
