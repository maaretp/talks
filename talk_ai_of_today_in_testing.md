# AI of Today in Testing

*Length: 30 or 45 minutes* 

Future is already here, it's just not evenly divided. Scifi-author Gibson's words are a great foundation for assessing how ongoing agile and automation transformation themes joined with artificial intelligence transformation themes are pushing a systemic change in testing. Equipped with communities and teams as units of work and social software development and testing techniques, the speaker brings Today's AI to Today's Testing with sociotechnical guardrails. 

This talk centers around three examples of applying AI tooling for testing purposes with technologies available today.
