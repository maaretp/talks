# Exploratory Testing Foundations

*Length: 1 day or 3x2 hrs*

Exploratory testing focuses on optimizing results and produces as one of its results better testing and testers. But what does that mean in practice? How do we test in a way that optimizes results and makes us better every day?

Exploratory testing an application can turn into a very different experience depending on the constraint you work with. Each session, we start with the same application so you will know it better each session, but with a different constraint.

This one day course is tailored to be delivered as a set of three two-hour sessions. In each session we start with a constraint, test in either pairs or groups, and reflect our lessons from the experiential learning.

Session 1. Explore with intent
Session 2. Explore using test automation as documentation
Session 3. Explore to confirm customer reports

Session 1: Explore with intent

This session focuses on learning about self-management skills as the core of exploratory testing. Exploratory testing an application can turn into a very different experience depending on the constraint you work with. In this session, we give you a constraint of being very intentional about your actions and learning. When you need to think on multiple levels at once, how do you learn to do that more effectively?

Session 2: Explore using test automation as documentation

Exploratory testing an application can turn into a very different experience depending on the constraint you work with. In this session, we give you a constraint of using Robot Framework, and your task is to drive testing through automation. You don't need to know Robot Framework or Test Automation for taking part in this session. What changes for exploratory testing when we work under this constraint?

Session 3: Explore to confirm customer reports

In this session, we give you a constraint of user reported bugs, and your task is to confirm these reports on an application you have not used before. What are the skills required for working from vague reports to specific and what are you learning about an application if what you learn about it is what others have complained about? Given the answer key to all the bugs we know of worth mentioning, we end the session in reflection of what it would have taken for us to find these during the course.
