# A Process / Compliancy Story, Case of an Organization

For last two years, we have been experimenting within the product development process in product team(s). 
In this talk, Iâ€™ll share the documentation-as-output style implementation of  process we ended up with, 
and discuss the challenges going forward. While we got from infrequent to frequent releases two times over failing

a thing or two about requirements. 

Key takeaways:
- Epics or Requirements or Both, and why?
- Jira Xray Test Traceability
- Turning overwhelming release process to continuous
