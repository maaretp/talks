# Code or Low Code - Navigating the Test Automation Options

*Length: 30 or 45 minutes* 

Being polyglot and polytool in test automation space is a lot of work. A recurring question for our automation efforts becomes choice of languages and tools. How do I know if my choice of tools is the right one? Is the next great thing really the next great thing, when they all promise increased productivity, especially now in the age of GenAI? 

After years of experiencing programmatic tests (python + libraries/frameworks; java + libraries/frameworks; javascript + libraries/frameworks) and open source orchestration (robot framework), I have now taken up commercial orchestration (UIPath) with promises of better packaging, low code approach and AI. With an inclination to love open sandboxes that grow to fit the capability of the programmer operating them today and incentives to learn to make the best of operating the commercial tool for real benefits, this talk invites you on a journey of comparison. A comparison of my experience, but also a comparison from six community volunteers lending a newbie automator framing I personally cannot have after years in automation space.

You will learn:

* How learning of code and low code tools differs?
* What is the minimal knowledge level of useful test automation contributions?
* Is there a difference for writing the tests and debugging the tests?
