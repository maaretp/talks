# Apply AI of Today on Your Testing

*Length: 1 day* 

## Overview

We have our day-to-day work in testing. We have new technologies available, and a lot of information on those. We aspire of artificial intellicence (AI) with computers acting humanly enough to pair with us in both attended and unattended fashion on our testing work, providing value. As creatures of habit, we need to build new habits in applying the technology pair in our daily work.

We have machine learning (ML), large language model (LLM), and retrieval augmented generation (RAG). We have GitHub Copilot, ChatCGP and Hugging Face. On this course, we take those, learn to work with those from examples and wrap up by building our very own course AI assistant. Instead of the averaged out idea that we all think of testing the average way, let's use RAG - Retrieval Augmented Generation - to create a pipeline to more input of instructions. 

While setting up to build our own, we understand what is available out of box, what sociotechnical guardrails we need and how to change our habits of building attended and unattended use of AI practice of testing. 

Course is a hands-on learning course, and exercises are done in ensemble testing format where we rotate roles to contribute as mindshare of the participants. The experiential frame of exercises ensures minimal time for setup and a shared hands-on experience on how to apply AI on testing tasks. 

This training day shows you:

* How to thoughtfully use other people's AI tools in your work
* How to break down testing tasks for useful results in pairing with AI
* How to build a habit of using AI tools to enhance your testing activities
* How to build a pipeline from your knowledge to the AI version of you

Opening of the day: learning goals

ML, LLM and RAG on AI world map

* Creating and using AI
* Pipeline thinking: inputs, filters, models, outputs
* Core sociotechnical guardrail: data ownership and confidentiality

Task analysis of what we do in testing

* Examples of testing tasks with AI assistance
* OpenAI ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Hugging Face and others
* Exercise: identifying and breaking down testing tasks

Activity: ChatGPT pair testing

* Benefiting from stochastic parrots
* Visible and invisible inputs, applied prompt engineering
* Exercise: GenAI ensemble testing

Activity: RAG yourself an assistant

* Example: 20 years of blogging as input
* Exercise: Three invisible inputs made visible to build your own assistant

Sociotechnical guardrails and creating an AI habit

* Essential sociotechnical guardrails: task breakdown, balancing attended and unattended, timing test activities, experimentation
* Making use of AI a habit, remembering core guardrail
* Amplifying fail signals of AI as realistic forward-facing foundation
