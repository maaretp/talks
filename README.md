# maaretp talk titles and descriptions 

With routine of delivering keynotes and talks, at some point I realized same questions get asked again. They need a talk proposal, 
and even if my current speaker rider includes refusal to copypaste, making these available in a structure makes sense. 

This repo is intended as source of *abstract available* links on my [personal page](https://maaretp.com/past_talks/), and it hosts 
talks I am building but haven√§t agreed on location to deliver - yet.
