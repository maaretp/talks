# Social Software Testing Approaches

*Length: 45 minutes* 

Software teams are well aware of the need for their developers, testers, product owners and other team members to collaborate. Product backlog refinement, 3-amigos sessions and daily meetings create space for sharing planning of the work, but for much of the rest of the time, people are hunched over their own keyboards and screens, working on their own tasks. Even if developers work with each other during pair programming and code review sessions, testers often work on their own.

Let’s look at the approaches involving a more social aspect that testers can adopt in order to work together and improve their testing, as well as work better with developers. We’ll introduce experiences of traditional and strong-style pair testing, ensemble (mob) testing and bug bashes. 

Social software testing approaches enable you to do better work together, moving you from co-creation to real collaboration both between testers, and testers and the other roles. Even if work could be done alone, why would the social way of doing the work make sense? It’s not about getting the most out of us, but the best out of us - avoiding the ping pong, creating ideas we would not generate alone, and sharpening our skills.

In addition to learning within the team, we can extend from learning within the team to community: testing tours applying these approaches give you hands-on experiences working with others even in other companies.  And now most recently - we have a shameless version of social, pairing with genAI tools.

In software development, those who learn the fastest do best. Could social software testing approaches take our abilities to the next level by enabling learning between everyone, especially when we don't know what we don't know but can recognize it in the context of doing it,  especially when we don't know what we don't know but can recognize it in the context of doing it?
