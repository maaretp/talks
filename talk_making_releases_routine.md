# Making Releases Routine

*Length: 30 or 45 minutes* 

Moving organizations from infrequent to frequent releases has been my signature move for a decade. While the successes of moving 
from 30 days to 30 minutes of release timeframe are things I have learned from, nothing teaches you like a good old failure. After a streak of improvements, 
last year I faced an interruption to the streak with a four month stabilization phase. 

We learned from the failure as a team, and I learned from the failure as an individual. With the odd change that you could try your own mix of failing, 
let's dissect my experience together. Having just completed the 7th release of year 2024 in the team, I can fairly certainly say we made releases routine, again. 

Key takeaways: 

* What is the necessary tester brain rewire
* How in practice we turn testing continuous and releases routine
* Importance of conceptual separation of the pipeline and the compliance
