# Exploratory Unit Testing with and for GenAI 

To focus on learning testing in python, let's take computer assisted software authorship (generative AI as our programmer) and frame ourselves accountable for results by testing what we have. 

With doing that, we'll walk through, in python code: 
1. Reviewing code that gets generated
2. Unit testing with examples, and importance of intent
3. Unit testing with approvals, and importance of locking 
4. Unit testing with properties, and generation of tests
5. Unit testing with a reference 
6. Knowing your domain, it will surprise you
7. Knowing your environment, it will surprise you

We'll wrap up with a conversation on the boundaries of programmers and testers, and if they should exist.
