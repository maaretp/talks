# Habit of AI in Quality Engineering

*Length: 45 min* 

Four years of programmatic tests with GitHub Copilot. One year of AI-generated pull request reviews. 
Three years of applying chat-based generative AI. Those four years have led to a habit of AI in the work I do, 
and I believe now, we need that habit distributed across the organization. 

In this talk we look at my use case examples: 
* Pair testing with Edge Copilot 
* Assisted programming with GitHub Copilot
* Working with changes to code with help of generative AI

From these examples, we pull together a conceptual model of models, filters, flows, visible and invisible inputs, 
and UX integration. The tools we have are enough to build a habit, and the conceptual model helps us extend that 
habit as more features based on generative AI become available. 

Let's build that habit of good use of the technology that serves us well as external imagination.
