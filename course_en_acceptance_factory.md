# Acceptance Factory

*Length: 1 day*

In this course, we learn to bring together AI, requirements and acceptance testing. Through a simulation of the beginning and the end of a feature, we learn how we can apply generative AI while clarifying and communicating our requirements using acceptance criteria and examples that serve as acceptance tests. 

The source is run as a simulation workshop. We start with what we know, describing an applicationâ€™s requirements, and using generative AI to help specify the features as stories, acceptance criteria and examples. We complete the acceptance factory circle by trying out using the examples with agentic test automation that turns examples into executed test results against the application we were specifying. 

The purpose of the course is not to teach you how to do things in production now. It is to give you a full circle taste of where we are with what can be done in practice today. 

You will learn: 

* How to use powerful online LLMs with data privacy awareness
* How to use local language models 
* How to create human-operated agents for specific tasks that support you
* How to use open-source agentic test automation to turn examples to test results
* What is a good epic / story and how to describe acceptance criteria and examples to illustrate the scope
* Transforming notes into standardized forms of specifications
* How communication is more in practice than writing and reading
* Incremental acceptance testing
