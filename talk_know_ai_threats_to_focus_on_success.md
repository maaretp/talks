# Know AI Threats to Focus on Success

*Length: 45 min* 

Professional testing expertise is about knowing how things go wrong and helping to correct the course. However, the time spent on warnings takes away from aiding success, and testing perspectives balance the timely and properly priorized amplification of failure signals. In this talk, we will discuss themed warnings about AI to focus on whether the issues are ones we can't live with when evaluating AI in testing.

We will cover the following themes:

* Humanizing technology
* Understanding AI and the need for system understanding
* Widespread plagiarism and distinguishing between illegal and otherwise wrong
* Societal and personal biases
* Data pollution
* Skill atrophy
* Keeping secrets secret and preserving local culture
* Redistribution of work
* AI-washing and green costs
* Masses of data and effort in refuting misinformation
* Sufficiently correct answers relative to risks
* Wrong solutions to right problems
* Squandering trust, defaulting to suspicion
* 2nd degree systems impact

The length of this list suggests that there has already been much discussion about risks and concerns. So, how do we balance the use of time between addressing threats and supporting success?
