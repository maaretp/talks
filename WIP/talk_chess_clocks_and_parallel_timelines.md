# Chess Clocks and Parallel Timelines - Test Planning for the Cracks

With agile, testers have become complacent expecting ticket in testing column. What about the testing work that is not the other side of the developer introducing a feature -ticket? 
How do you plan for that? And how do you plan for things that takes months or years to lead up to, like world-class competencies and capabilities? 

We used to have test managers and (master) test plans. Now we have a backlog to build. Backlog building and related conversations about time and decision power may well be improved 
with two thinking tools I have been playing with: the chess clocks, and the parallel timelines. This talk is still fuzzy but it tries to capture a special power I hold as a tester: seeing the cracks, 
the negative space and being intentional on moving the givens to where they need to be.
